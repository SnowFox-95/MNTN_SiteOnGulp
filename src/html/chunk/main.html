          <h2 class="article-title">Picking the right Hiking Gear!</h2>
          <p>The nice thing about beginning hiking is that you don’t really need any special gear, you can probably get away with things you already have.

          <h2 class="article-title">Understand Your Map & Timing</h2>
          <p>To start, print out the hiking guide and map. If it’s raining, throw them in a Zip-Lock bag. Read over the guide, study the map, and have a good idea of what to expect. I like to know what my next landmark is as I hike. For example, I’ll read the guide and know that say, in a mile, I make a right turn at the junction..</p>
